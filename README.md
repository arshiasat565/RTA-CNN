# An End-to-End Atrial Fibrillation Detection by A Novel Residual-Based Temporal Attention Convolutional Neural Network with Exponential Nonlinearity Loss
This repository provides source code of RTA-CNN for ECG signal classification and atrial fibrillation detection.


# Dataset
To evaluate our method, we used The dataset of [The 2017 PhysioNet Challenge][data_link]. The challenge aims to encourage the development of algorithms to classify, from a single short ECG lead recording (between 30 s and 60 s in length), whether the recording shows normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation (AF), an alternative rhythm, or is too noisy to be classified.


# Requirements
* [Tensorflow][tensorflow_link] version >=1.13.1.
* [Keras][keras_link] version >=2.2.4
* Some basic python packages such as Numpy, Matplotlib.
